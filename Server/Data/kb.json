So a Credit Note needs to be raised to cancel\nout the invoice on the ledger and a fresh invoice will then need to be created containing the\ncorrect information.\n\nIf WIP has been added to the original invoice, you can remove this (so that it is available to\npull through to the replacement invoice) by opening the invoice and going into the bill line(s):\nRight click on the WIP entry and select Remove WIP. Save & Close the bill line. Save &\nClose the invoice.\n\nThe development team are aware that several customers have indicated that they would like\nthe ability to make minor edits to finalised bills - such as editing the description - and they\nare looking to enhance the program to allow this in a future upgrade.\nIf it is just a minor error on the return, such as a slight spelling mistake, then you may wish\nto elect to export the invoice to RTF so that you can edit the customer's copy in Word, rather\nthan create a fresh invoice, but please bear in mind that the invoice details saved in the\ndatabase will remain unchanged.\n\n[Can I edit a finalised invoice if a mistake has been made.pdf](/.attachments/Can%20I%20edit%20a%20finalised%20invoice%20if%20a%20mistake%20has%20been%20made-c0ed988a-2f91-480a-849e-5e1903e06f74.pdf)"

You then have the option to create a new template, modify an existing template or clone a template.\nThere are various reports supplied with the software which may help setting up your templates\n- Blank address: A blank template with the basic address merge fields.\n- Engagement cover: Contains the address fields and some example text.\n- Marketing demo: Also contains the address fields and some example text.\n- Label: Setup to enable you to create labels, however you would need to edit the template to suit the\ntype of label you are printing.\n3. Having selected the method of editing the template, Microsoft Word will open and will enable you to\nenter the text in the body of the template. You can also select the merge fields to use from the Mailings\ntab, and selecting insert merge field.\n(Please note, if you add a Header and/or Footer the details contained will only appear if you elect to\nview the document for printing. If you wish these details to also be available if the document is used\nfor emails, please ensure ALL details are added to the main body of the template, and not added as a\nheader or footer, as headers and footers are stripped out when the details go onto email).\n4. Once you have the information and the desired template format save the file. This will save the\ntemplate to the Practice Management Templates folder and is now ready to use with your Practice\nManagement client data.\nTo create the mail merge:\n1. From the client or contact list highlight the entities you would like to create a document for.\n2. Select the option to âCreate office documentâ, this will launch the Mail merge wizard.\n3. Click Next.\n4. Select Generate a document using a template and click Next.\n5. Select a template from the list and click Next\n6. Add a Reference and/or Signatory as required.

Specify the default filename format by selecting your chosen\nparameters from the drop-down list using the button. You can also enter any additional text to create a\ncustomised filename. Any standard characters valid for filenames are allowed; invalid characters\ninclude /\\:*?\"<>|. Click Next.\n8. Set any additional options. Select the Save datasource file check box to save the file as a CommaSeparated (.csv) file.\nSelect the Add note to each recipient's contact history check box and specify a note to track who\nhas received letters. These appear on the Notes lists on the General tab, and is a useful way to track\nwho has received letters.\n9. Click Next.\n10.

If you wish to save these steps, for use again as a Fast Letter please tick the box to Save Settings\nto Database (or leave the box unticked if not applicable). Click Finish to close the Wizard.\nIf you select Send documents via email:\n1. Digita Practice Management requests access to your email application. The emails are sent from\nthe account to which you grant access via this dialog.\nThis does not apply any signatures specified via your email application. Therefore you may wish to\nedit templates to include any required signature and disclaimer information.\n2. Enter a title in the Subject field. This field is mandatory.\n3. Choose whether to send the documents as an attachment or in the body of the email.\n4. In the Output field, select whether to:\n- Send the emails immediately\n- Save the emails in your Drafts folder\n- Open each email.\n5.

Clients are not able to\nsee the other recipients on the list, each email only contains one client in the To: field.\n6.If you specified a Note it is only applied to clients/contacts that have had the email successfully sent.\nYou may want to set up some categories for each set of emails. You can then select this category on\nthis note, to signify the contacts/clients that have received the email.\nIf you select I do not wish to send the documents:\nThe documents are created and saved to the clients' folders.\n\n[Document Creation - How do I setup and run a mail merge.pdf](/.attachments/Document%20Creation%20-%20How%20do%20I%20setup%20and%20run%20a%20mail%20merge-95c2ba28-7431-4a18-9f13-a7a42fea9233.pdf)"

This\ndate won't update each time the saved letter is opened.\nTo do this we can use the QUOTE function, this turns the output into a string rather than a field so it\ndoesnât get updated.\nYou will need to create a merge field with the following content on the mail merge template:\n{QUOTE {DATE \\@ \"dd/MM/yyy\"} }\nTo enter this you need to:\n1. Display field codes (ALT+F9)\n2. Then use CTRL+F9 to enter create the {}\n3. Type QUOTE then CTRL+F9 again to give {QUOTE{}}\n4. Then type DATE \\@\"dd/MM/yyyy\" to give {QUOTE{DATE \\@\"dd/MM/yyyy\"}}\n5.
